# Team Contributions
Our team had some trouble while working on a previous repo so we moved onto a new one as it was more tidy. 

Our repo contains 5 branches besides main. Each of these branches were made for specifically for a new chunk of the assingment. Some were made for debugging purposes and others for new features.

Much of the final changes and simple files like sql scripts were commited directly to the main branch

# Team Challenges

Our team faced a few challenges during this project. One of the biggest challenges being working with the Apache Maven tool. The team spent hours working through the bugs but to no avail. Ultimatly we scrapped this idea and went for another approach instead.
